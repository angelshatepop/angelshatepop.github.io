<h3>FOR THOSE WHO DELVE DEEP INTO THE COMMITS</h3>

the original "plus" website will be transfered out of github and replaced with a personal blog site. 
the orignal "plus" website will be used mainly for business/art purposes on an independent domain.
the website replacing the current one will be strictly for blogging about personal projects and research i find interesting.
